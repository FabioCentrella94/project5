# E-COMMERCE WEB APPLICATION #

For this project I've built only the frontend with Vanilla JavaScript to consume API's served from the backend.
<br>
Deployed both frontend and backend on AWS using App Runner, S3 and CloudFront.

<br>
The carousel shows the teddies for sale. The user can view them singularly, choose the color, updated the quantity and add them to the basket to place an order.
